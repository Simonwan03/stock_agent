Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“ Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \nimpact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and other measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from \nthe results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “ Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www. apple. com, and its investor relations website, investor. apple. com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s \nreferences to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel \ninventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS®Tahoe 26, iPadOS®26, watchOS®26, visionOS®26 and tvOS®26.\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 13\n\nTariffs and Other Measures\n\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U. S. (“ U. S. Tariffs”), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (“ EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U. S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U. S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in \nthe future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U. S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can \nhave a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U. S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory \nmeasures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\n\nSegment Operating Performance\n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024 (dollars in millions):\n\n                            Three Months Ended                                                                            \n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n                            June 28,                                        Change                                Change  \n  Americas                  $                       41,198      37,678           9      134,161      125,381           7  \n  Europe                                            24,014      21,884          10       82,329       76,404           8  \n  Greater China                                     15,369      14,728           4       49,884       51,919         (4)  \n  Japan                                              5,782       5,097          13       22,067       19,126          15  \n  Rest of Asia Pacific                               7,673       6,390          20       25,254       23,275           9  \n  Total net sales           $                       94,036      85,777          10      313,695      296,105           6  \n\nAmericas\n\nAmericas net sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nItem 3.

For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 28, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2025, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 19\n\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (the “ DMA”) (the “ Article 5(4) Investigation”). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened\nan additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (the “ Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative \ndistribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it\ndeems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\n\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the U. S. Department of Justice (the “ DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U. S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil \nlitigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U. S. alleging similar violations of U. S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nEpic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. (“ Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “ California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the “2021 \nInjunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U. S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS® App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On \nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer’s\nchoice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company’s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court’s most recent decision to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \n(the “ Ninth Circuit Court”). Although the Company’s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company’s appeal on an expedited basis, with arguments scheduled for October 2025.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts \nabove management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 20\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended December 28, 2024 (the “first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q”) and March 29, 2025 (the “second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q”), in each case under the heading “ Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks \nmaterialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factors disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of the first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q and the second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nItem 2.

On May 1, 2025, the Company announced an additional program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company’s common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market \ntransactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\n\nItem 3.
